## Memeify Your Speech!!!

Simply copy the text you want to memeify and then run the Memeifier.

It's that easy!

## How to Use

1. Copy target text into system clipboard.
2. Run MEMEIFIER.jar
3. Paste Memeified text!

Sidenote: I recommend creating a shell script that runs your Memeifier for you
          so that you can pin it to your taskbar and so just click the icon to run it.

Sidenote note: You can also set a shortcut key for your script so that you can run it
              with just your keyboard.

## History
I wrote this script a while back for personal usage when a recent interaction inspired me
to bring this wonder into the light again.

I hope this will bring you as much joy as it brings me!
